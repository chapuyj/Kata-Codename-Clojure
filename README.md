Of the **9 words** you you see as **green**, **3 are also green** on the other side of the key card. That means together you have only **15 words to guess**.

Of the **three words** you see as **black**, **one is black**, **one is green**, and **one is beige** on the **other side** of the key card. This means that one word you see as black is a word you must guess.
